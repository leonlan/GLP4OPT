# Good Laboratory Practice for Optimization Research
Good Laboratory Practice for Optimization Research (GLP4OPT) is a set of recommendations introduced by [Kendall et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jors.2015.77) to enhance the reproducibility and quality of research carried out by the optimization community. The recommendations are applicable to areas of optimization where simulations are carried out, whether that is exact methods, heuristics, meta-heuristics or hyper-heuristics. 

## Motivation for checklist
The guidelines by GLP4OPT are presented in Section 4 of Kendall et al. (2016). To easily check if your work follows all recommendations, I created a checklist in Markdown so that you can easily check off each recommendation. There are two versions of the checklist:
- [`checklist-long.md`](https://github.com/leonlan/glp4opt/blob/master/checklist-long.md): This file includes all GLP4OPT recommendations as checklist, including the motivation behind the guidelines.
- [`checklist-short.md`](https://github.com/leonlan/glp4opt/blob/master/checklist-short.md): This file only includes the GLP4OPT recommendations without motivation.

If you work on Github, I recommend to copy-paste the checklist to an [issue](https://github.com/leonlan/glp4opt/issues/8) or a [discussion thread](https://github.com/leonlan/glp4opt/discussions/11) so that you can easily check off each recommendation.
